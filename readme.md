## How to set up this repo for the first time

**Before cloning the project, make sure you have [the Git LFS plugin installed](https://git-lfs.github.com/)!** After you've installed it, run

`git lfs install`

You'll only need to do that once!

Once Git LFS is installed, clone this repo and you should then be able
to use it like any other Github repo. Direct downloads will not work. If you
cloned the repo and you cannot open the files still, delete your local copy
of the repo and go through the Git LFS installation instructions and *then*
clone it.

*What is Git LFS?* Git Large File Storage replaces large binary files
like graphics with text pointers inside Git. What this means is you
won't be clogging your hard drive up with previous diffs unless you want
them.

## Conflicts

Unfortunately there's no elegant way around binary file conflicts.
Fortunately, it's very unlikely to happen irl.

Keep both files, name them differently or throw one into `/archived`.
Feel free to add your own named folders (i.e. `/pirijan`) to this repo too.
